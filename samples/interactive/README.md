## interactive

A simple console application that requires you to "signup" with a service that uses submarine and give it some secret data. You can then view the secret you gave, view how it seen in the database, or forget the secret forever (by having submarine delete your key).

This example is very similar to the [simple](https://github.com/kurtinlane/submarine/tree/master/samples/simple) application, except that it is interactive and it shows the process of deleting a key.

### run it:

`go run samples/interactive/test.go`
